                Reading is a hobby I've had for so long! It allows me to widen my vocabulary
                and enhance my imagination. I like thriller books the most as it keeps me at the edge of my seat.
                Some recommendations includes Sherlock books by Arthur Conan Doyle, Nancy Drew series, and The Housemaid by Freida McFadden.
